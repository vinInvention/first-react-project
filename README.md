#Description
This is a basic React application created inside the new-blog folder. The app currently renders a simple "Hello World" message to the DOM. It serves as the starting point for exploring and building more complex React features such as components, props, state management, routing, and API integration.

The project was initialized using Create React App, providing a structured environment with all the essential tools (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) pre-configured.
